All the root files mentioned below are checked in. 
You need the HiForest environment to run the macros.
Check if the description below if a macro is to be complied or not.


Prepare3DHistos.C:
------------------
Prepares and saves the 'light' (eta,pt,phi) +D histograms from the HiForest.
Output is TrkCorr_3DHistos_pThat80_Inclusive.root. You need to compile 
the macro.


ComputeAcceptanceWeight.C:
--------------------------
Computes the acceptance weights and saves them in a root file called 
AcceptanceWeights.root. NO need to compile the macro.


ComputeCentralityWeight.C:
--------------------------
Computes the centrality weights. Very messy...
You need to compile it; also plots the fits, etc. Output file is 
CentralityWeights.root. Compile the macro.


CheckClosure_MyCorrections.C:
-----------------------------
Check closure against the HiForest using my corrections. Various 
distributions are plotted. Check the messy code, the names of the 
histograms speak for themselves. You need to compile the macro.
